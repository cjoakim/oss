Q: What is the Quicken interchange format (QIF)?

A: The Quicken interchange format (QIF) is a specially formatted text (ASCII)
   file that lets you to move Quicken transactions: 

From one Quicken account register into another Quicken account register, or 
To/From another application that supports the QIF format. 
Note: For Quicken to translate data from a text file into the Quicken register
as transactions, the text file must be in the QIF format. 


Required File Formatting: 


Each transaction must end with a symbol, indicating the end of entry. 
Each item in the transaction must display on a separate line. 
When Quicken exports an account register or list, it adds a line to the top 
of the file that identifies the type of account or list.  Listed below are 
the header lines Quicken adds to the exported files: 

Header           Type of data  
!Type:Bank       Bank account transactions  
!Type:Cash       Cash account transactions  
!Type:CCard      Credit card account transactions  
!Type:Invst      Investment account transactions  
!Type:Oth A      Asset account transactions  
!Type:Oth L      Liability account transactions  
!Account         Account list or which account follows  
!Type:Cat        Category list 
!Type:Class      Class list 
!Type:Memorized  Memorized transaction list  


You can force Quicken to import all transfers, regardless of whether 
Ignore Transfers is selected when the file is imported.  You must add a 
line to the file being imported into a Quicken account.  Use a text editor
or word processor to put the following line right after the header line 
at the top of the file:

!Option:AllXfr

Items for Non-Investment Accounts 

Each item in a bank, cash, credit card, other liability, or other asset 
account must begin with a letter that indicates the field in the Quicken
